# Development Status

This project is early stage, so expect things to break all the time. 

This is roughly the road to 1.0:

- [ ] All essential parsers
- [ ] All essential combinators
- [ ] Lexer
- [ ] Streaming input
- [x] Basic debugging
- [ ] Parser state, positions
- [ ] Expression parser helpers
- [ ] Debug trees
- [ ] Monoidal parser types
- [ ] Profiling & performance
- [ ] Inliner
- [ ] Comparison tests for canonical and performant implementations
- [ ] Tutorial
- [ ] API Documentation
- [ ] Better parser assertions
- [ ] Implementations of some typical real world parsers (markdown, json, ...)
