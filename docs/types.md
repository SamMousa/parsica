# Types

## String and Character

PHP doesn't have a separate type for strings and characters, as opposed to some languages where string is defined as a list of characters. Still, as a convention in this library and it's documentation, we generally use `'a'`, `'1'` (single quoted) to indicate a single character, and `"a"`, `"abc123"` (double quoted) to indicate a string.

We also use single quotes to indicate constant strings or symbols, such as `'STATUS_SUCCESS'`;
